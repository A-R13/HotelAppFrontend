Text Alternatives for Images:
- Descriptive alt text was provided for images to convey their meaning if the images are not availble or for users who rely on screen readers
- Text alternatives were implemented for graphics and icons. Eg (when booking; the bedrooms, bathroom icons had labels to allow users to distinguish between them and avoid confusion)

Readable Text:
- Clear and legible fonts with an appropriate font size were used.
- We used appropriate heading tags (h1, h2, large, small) to create a logical document outline.

Aria Roles and Attributes:
- ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles and attributes were implemented to enhance the accessibility of the content on the page.
- ARIA labels were particularly used on buttons to allow users to effortesly naviagte through the application

Form Accessibility:
- We made sure that the form fields had clear and programmatically associated labels.
- Also error messages and alerts were implemented in a way that was perceivable by screen readers.
