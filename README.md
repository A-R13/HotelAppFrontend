Focus on providing features such as keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and high-contrast modes where necessary.
4. State Management Without Refreshing
Build a single-page application (SPA) that does not require a page refresh for state updates.
Implement state management using ReactJS features like hooks, context API, or other relevant libraries (e.g., Redux, if necessary).
5. User Authentication and Authorization
Include functionality that provides access to certain features when users are logged in, and limit features when they are not logged in.
Ensure secure and seamless login functionality, such as managing user sessions and data based on authentication status.
6. Feature Set Implementation
Implement all required features and screens, including user registration, property listing, search functionality, property details, booking processes, and user reviews.
Follow the structure outlined in the requirements (popups, modals, or entire pages) for different application states.
7. Integrate with Backend API
